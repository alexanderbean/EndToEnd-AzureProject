# EndToEnd-AzureProject



Imported data from .csv files into Azure Gen2 Data Lake Storage.

Created 3 BLOB storage containers in data lake for raw data, staging data, and transformed data.

Created a pipeline to duplicate the raw data files into the staging data container.

Transformed the staging data using Databricks and imported into transformed data container.

Created schema in SQL Server Management Studio and developed a pipeline to load the transformed data into Azure SQL server.

Visualized the Azure SQL Server data in Power BI Desktop.



I established a Git repo connection to Data Factory after all the pipelines were completed.
